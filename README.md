Advent of code 2022 in Fortran

https://adventofcode.com/

The solution for each day is implemented in `yyyy/n/main.f90`, where `yyyy` is the year and `n` is the day, e.g. 2022/1, 2022/2, 2022/3, ...

To compile and run an implementation:

    cd 2022/1
    ../../build.sh
    ./main

The solution is printed to the console.

## Requirements

1. A Fortran compiler, preferably `gfortran` or `ifort`.  Configure the compiler in [`build.sh`](build.sh).

My difficulty ratings are obviously subjective.  What's hard for me might be easy for others.  Also, there is a path-dependence to the difficulty.  For example, I thought [2022 day 7](2022/7) was particularly hard compared to days 1-6, mostly because I had never implemented a general tree data structure in Fortran.  After that, I used trees in several other days (e.g. [day 13](2022/13)).  Since I already had trees in my toolbelt, I didn't feel like that was as difficult anymore.
