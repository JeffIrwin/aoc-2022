Advent of code 2022 in Fortran

https://adventofcode.com/

The solution for each day is implemented in `n/main.f90`, where `n` is the day, e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...

To compile and run an implementation:

    cd 1
    ../build.sh
    ./main

The solution is printed to the console.

## Requirements

1. A Fortran compiler, preferably `gfortran` or `ifort`.  Configure the compiler in [`build.sh`](build.sh).
